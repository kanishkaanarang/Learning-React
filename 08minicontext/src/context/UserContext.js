export default UserContext;
// This file creates a UserContext using React's Context API.
// It exports the UserContext so that it can be used in other components to provide and consume user-related data throughout the application.
// The context can be used to share user information like authentication status,
// user preferences, or any other user-related data without having to pass props down through every level of the component tree.
// To use this context, components can wrap themselves in a UserContext.Provider and
// use UserContext.Consumer or the useContext hook to access the context value.
